<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF CHAUCER.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 131. 133.)</p>

  <p>I am glad to perceive that some of the correspondents of "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" are turning their attention to the
  elucidation of Chaucer. The text of our father-poet, having remained as
  it were in fallow since the time of Tyrwhitt, now presents a rich field
  for industry; and, in offering free port and entry to all comments and
  suggestions, to be there sifted and garnered up, the pages of "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" may soon become a depository from
  which ample materials may be obtained for a new edition of Chaucer, now
  become an acknowledged desideratum.</p>

  <p>One excellent illustration has lately been added, at page 133., in a
  note without signature upon "Nettle in, dock out." If <i>confirmed</i><a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, it will furnish
  not only a most satisfactory explanation of that hitherto
  incomprehensible phrase, but also a curious example of the faithful
  preservation of an exact form of words through centuries of oral
  tradition.</p>

  <p>And if the note which precedes it, at page 131., upon a passage in
  Palamon and Arcite, is less valuable, it is because it is deficient in
  one of the most essential conditions which such communications ought to
  possess&mdash;that of originality. No suggestion ought to be offered
  which had been previously published in connexion with the same subject:
  at least in any <i>very obvious</i> place of reference, such as notes or
  glossaries already appended to well-known editions of the text.</p>

  <p>Now the precise explanation of the planetary distribution of the
  twenty-four hours of the day, given by <span title="e" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;</span>. in the first portion of his communication, was
  anticipated seventy or eighty years ago by Tyrwhitt in his note upon the
  same passage of Palamon and Arcite. And with respect to <span title="e" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;</span>.'s second explanation of the meaning of "houre
  inequal," that expression also has been commented upon by Tyrwhitt, who
  attributes it to the well-known expansive duration of ancient hours, the
  length of which was regulated by that of the natural day at the several
  seasons of the year: hence an <i>inequality</i> always existed; except at
  the equinoxes, between hours before, and hours after, sunrise. This is
  undoubtedly the true explanation, since Chaucer was, at the time,
  referring to hours before and after sunrise upon the same day. On the
  contrary, <span title="e" class="grk">&epsilon;</span>.'s ecliptic hours,
  if they ever existed at all (he has cited no authority), would be
  obviously incompatible with the planetary disposition of the hours first
  referred to.</p>

  <p>I shall now, in my turn, suggest explanations of the two new
  difficulties in Chaucer's text, to <!-- Page 202 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>{202}</span>which, at the
  conclusion of his note, <span title="e" class="grk">&epsilon;</span>. has
  drawn attention.</p>

  <p>The first is, that, "with respect to the time of year at which the
  tournament takes place, there seems to be an inconsistency." Theseus
  fixes "this day fifty wekes" from the fourth of May, as the day on which
  the final contention must come off, and yet the day previous to the final
  contention is afterwards alluded to as "the lusty seson of that May,"
  which, it is needless to say, would be inconsistent with an interval of
  fifty <i>ordinary</i> weeks.</p>

  <p>But fifty weeks, if taken in their literal sense of 350 days, would be
  a most unmeaning interval for Theseus to fix upon,&mdash;it would almost
  require explanation as much as the difficulty itself: it is therefore
  much easier to suppose that Chaucer meant to imply the interval of a
  solar year. Why he should choose to express that interval by fifty,
  rather than by fifty-two, weeks, may be surmised in two ways: first,
  because the latter phrase would be unpoetical and unmanageable; and,
  secondly, because he might fancy that the week of the Pagan Theseus would
  be more appropriately represented by a lunar quarter than by a Jewish
  hebdomad.</p>

  <p>Chaucer sometimes makes the strangest jumble&mdash;mixing up together
  Pagan matters and Christian, Roman and Grecian, ancient and modern; so
  that although he names Sunday and Monday as two of the days of the week
  in Athens, he does so evidently for the purpose of introducing the
  allocation of the hours, alluded to before, to which the planetary names
  of the days of the week were absolutely necessary. But in the fifty weeks
  appointed by Theseus, the very same love of a little display of erudition
  would lead Chaucer to choose the <i>hebdomas lunæ</i>, or lunar quarter,
  which the Athenian youth were wont to mark out by the celebration of a
  feast to Apollo on every seventh day of the moon. But after the first
  twenty-eight days of every lunar month, the weekly reckoning must have
  been discontinued for about a day and a half (when the new moon was what
  was called "in coitu," or invisible), after which a new reckoning of
  sevens would recommence. Hence there could be but four hebdomades in each
  lunar month; and as there are about twelve and a half lunar months in a
  solar year, so must there have been fifty lunar weeks in one solar
  year.</p>

  <p>It will explain many anomalies, even in Shakspeare, if we suppose that
  our early writers were content to show their knowledge of a subject in a
  few particulars, and were by no means solicitous to preserve, what
  moderns would call <i>keeping</i>, in the whole performance.</p>

  <p>The next difficulty, adverted to by <span title="e" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;</span>., is the mention of the <span class="scac">THIRD</span>
  as the morning upon which Palamon "brake his prison," and Arcite went
  into the woods "to don his observaunce to May."</p>

  <p>There is not perhaps in the whole of Chaucer's writings a more
  exquisite passage than that by which the latter circumstance is
  introduced; it is well worth transcribing:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The besy larke, the messager of day,</p>
      <p>Sal&#x113;weth in hire song the morw&#x113; gray;</p>
      <p>And firy Phebus riseth up so bright,</p>
      <p>That all the orient laugheth at the sight;</p>
      <p>And with his strem&#x113;s drieth in the greves</p>
      <p>The silver drop&#x113;s hanging on the leves."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Such is the description of the morning of the "thridde of May;" and
  perhaps, if no other mention of that date were to be found throughout
  Chaucer's works, we might be justified in setting it down as a random
  expression, to which no particular meaning was attached. But when we find
  it repeated in an entirely different poem, and the same "observaunce to
  May" again associated with it, the conviction is forced upon us that it
  cannot be without some definite meaning.</p>

  <p>This repetition occurs in the opening of the second book of <i>Troilus
  and Creseide</i>, where "the thridde" has not only "observaunce to May"
  again attributed to it, but also apparently some peculiar virtue in
  dreams. No sooner does Creseide behold Pandarus on the morning of the
  third of May, than "<i>by the hond on hie, she tooke him fast</i>," and
  tells him that she had thrice dreamed of him that night. Pandarus replies
  in what appears to have been a set form of words suitable to the
  occasion&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Yea, nece, ye shall faren well the bet,</p>
      <p>If God wull, all this yeare."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now unless the third of May were supposed to possess some unusual
  virtue, the dreaming on that morning could scarcely confer a whole year's
  welfare. But, be that as it may, there can at least be no doubt that
  Chaucer designedly associated <i>some</i> celebration of the advent of
  May with the morning of the third of that month.</p>

  <p>Without absolutely asserting that my explanation is the true one, I
  may nevertheless suggest it until some better may be offered. It is, that
  the association may have originated in the invocation of the goddess
  Flora, by Ovid, on that day (<i>Fasti</i>, v.), in order that she might
  inspire him with an explanation of the Floralia, or Floral games, which
  were celebrated in Rome from the 28th of April to the <i>third</i> of
  May.</p>

  <p>These games, if transferred by Chaucer to Athens, would at once
  explain the "gret feste" and the "lusty seson of that May."</p>

  <p>Supposing, then, that Chaucer, in the <i>Knight's Tale</i>, meant, as
  I think he meant, to place the great combat on the anniversary of the
  fourth of May&mdash;that being the day on which Theseus had intercepted
  the duel,&mdash;then the entry into Athens of the rival companies would
  take place on <!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page203"></a>{203}</span>(Sunday) the second, and the sacrifices
  and feasting on the <i>third of May</i>, the last of the Floralia.</p>

<h3>ON A PASSAGE IN MARMION.</h3>

  <p>I venture for the first time to trespass upon the attention of your
  readers in making the following remarks upon a passage in <i>Marmion</i>,
  which, as far as I know, has escaped the notice of all the critical
  writers whose comments upon that celebrated poem have hitherto been
  published.</p>

  <p>It will probably be remembered, that long after the main action of the
  poem and interest of the story have been brought to a close by the death
  of the hero on the field of Flodden, the following incident is thus
  pointedly described:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Short is my tale:&mdash;Fitz-Eustace' care</p>
      <p>A pierced and mangled body bare</p>
      <p>To moated Lichfield's lofty pile:</p>
      <p>And there, beneath the southern aisle,</p>
      <p>A tomb, with Gothic sculpture fair</p>
      <p>Did long Lord Marmion's image bear,</p>
      <p class="i3">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"There erst was martial Marmion found,</p>
      <p>His feet upon a couchant hound,</p>
      <p class="i1">His hands to Heaven upraised:</p>
      <p>And all around on scutcheon rich,</p>
      <p>And tablet carved, and fretted niche,</p>
      <p class="i1">His arms and feats were blazed.</p>
      <p>And yet, though all was carved so fair,</p>
      <p>And priest for Marmion breathed the prayer,</p>
      <p><i>The last Lord Marmion lay not there.</i></p>
      <p>From Ettrick woods a peasant swain</p>
      <p>Follow'd his lord to Flodden plain,&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i3">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sore wounded Sybil's Cross he spied,</p>
      <p>And dragg'd him to its foot, and died,</p>
      <p>Close by the noble Marmion's side.</p>
      <p>The spoilers stripp'd and gash'd the slain,</p>
      <p>And thus their corpses were mista'en;</p>
      <p>And thus in the proud Baron's tomb,</p>
      <p>The lowly woodsman took the room."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now, I ask, wherefore has the poet dwelt with such minuteness upon
  this forced and improbable incident? Had it indeed been with no other
  purpose than to introduce the picturesque description and the moral
  reflexions contained in the following section, the improbability might
  well be forgiven. But such is not the real object. The critic of the
  <i>Monthly Review</i> takes the following notice of this passage, which
  is printed as a note in the last edition of Scott's <i>Poems</i> in
  1833:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A corpse is afterwards conveyed, as that of Marmion, to the cathedral
  of Lichfield, where a magnificent tomb is erected to his memory, &amp;c.
  &amp;c.; but, by an <i>admirably imagined act of poetical justice</i>, we
  are informed that a peasant's body was placed beneath that costly
  monument, while the haughty Baron himself was buried like a vulgar corpse
  on the spot where he died."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Had the reviewer attempted to penetrate a little deeper into the
  workings of the author's mind, he would have seen in this circumstance
  much more than "an admirably imagined act of poetical <!-- Page 204
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>{204}</span>justice." He
  would have perceived in it the ultimate and literal fulfilment of the
  whole penalty foreshadowed to the delinquent baron in the two concluding
  stanzas of that beautiful and touching song sung by Fitz-Eustace in the
  Hostelrie of Gifford in the third canto of the poem, which I here
  transcribe:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Where shall the traitor rest,</p>
      <p class="i1">He the deceiver,</p>
      <p>Who could win maiden's breast,</p>
      <p class="i1">Ruin, and leave her?</p>
      <p>In the lost battle</p>
      <p class="i1">Borne down by the flying,</p>
      <p>Where mingles war's rattle,</p>
      <p class="i1">With groans of the dying&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i2">There shall he be lying.</p>
      <p>Her wing shall the eagle flap</p>
      <p class="i1">O'er the false-hearted,</p>
      <p>His warm blood the wolf shall lap</p>
      <p class="i1">Ere life be parted.</p>
      <p><i>Shame and dishonour sit</i></p>
      <p class="i1"><i>By his grave ever;</i></p>
      <p><i>Blessing shall hallow it,</i></p>
      <p class="i1"><i>Never, O never!</i>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Then follows the effect produced upon the conscience of the "Traitor,"
  described in these powerful lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It ceased. the melancholy sound;</p>
      <p>And silence sunk on all around.</p>
      <p>The air was sad; but sadder still</p>
      <p class="i1">It fell on Marmion's ear,</p>
      <p>And plain'd as if disgrace and ill,</p>
      <p class="i1">And shameful death, were near."</p>
      <p class="i3">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And lastly, when the life of the wounded baron is ebbing forth with
  his blood on the field of battle, when&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The Monk, with unavailing cares</p>
      <p>Exhausted all the Church's prayers&mdash;</p>
      <p>Ever, he said, that, close and near,</p>
      <p>A lady's voice was in his ear,</p>
      <p>And that the priest he could not hear&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i1">For that she ever sung,</p>
      <p class="hg1">'<i>In the lost battle, borne down by the flying,</i></p>
      <p><i>Where mingles war's rattle with groans of the dying!</i>'&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i1">So the notes ring."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I am the more disposed to submit these remarks to your readers,
  because it is highly interesting to trace an irresistible tendency in the
  genius of this mighty author towards the fulfilment of prophetic legends
  and visions of second sight: and not to extend this paper to an
  inconvenient length, I purpose to resume the subject in a future number,
  and collate some other examples of a similar character from the works of
  Sir Walter Scott.</p>

  <p>I write from the southern slopes of Cheviot, almost within sight of
  the Hill of Flodden. During the latter years of the great Border
  Minstrel, I had the happiness to rank myself among the number of his
  friends and acquaintances, and I revere his memory as much as I prized
  his friendship.</p>

<h3>GLOUCESTERSHIRE PROVINCIALISMS.</h3>

  <p><i>To burl, burling; to shunt, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;In the report of the
  evidence regarding the death of Mrs. Hathway, at Chipping Sodbury,
  supposed to have been poisoned by her husband, the following dialectical
  expression occurs, which may deserve notice. One of the witnesses stated
  that he was invited by Mr. Hathway to go with him into a beer-house in
  Frampton Cotterell, "and have a tip," but he declined.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. H. went in and called for a quart of beer, and then came out
  again, and I went in. He told me 'to burl out the beer, as he was in a
  hurry;' and I 'burled' out a glass and gave it to
  him."&mdash;<i>Times</i>, Feb. 28.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I am not aware that the use of this verb, as a provincialism, has been
  noticed; it is not so given by Boucher, Holloway, or Halliwell. In the
  Cumberland dialect, a <i>birler</i>, or <i>burler</i>, is the master of
  the revels, who presides over the feast at a Cumberland bidden-wedding,
  and takes especial care that the drink be plentifully provided.
  (<i>Westmoreland and Cumberland Dialects</i>, London, 1839.)</p>

  <p>Boucher and Jamieson have collected much regarding the obsolete use of
  the verb <i>to birle</i>, to carouse, to pour out liquor. See also Mr.
  Dyce's notes on <i>Elynour Rummyng</i>, v. 269. (<i>Skelton's Works</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 167.). It is a good old Anglo-Saxon word&mdash;byrlian,
  <i>propinare</i>, <i>haurire</i>. In the Wycliffite versions it occurs
  repeatedly, signifying to give to drink. See the Glossary to the valuable
  edition lately completed by Sir F. Madden and Mr. Forshall.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i>, vol i. p. 51., we
  find&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Bryllare of drynke, or schenkare: Bryllyn, or schenk drynke,
  <i>propino</i>: Bryllynge of drynke," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whilst on the subject of dialectical expressions, I would mention an
  obsolete term which has by some singular chance recently been revived,
  and is actually in daily use throughout England in the railway
  vocabulary&mdash;I mean the verb "to shunt." Nothing is more common than
  to see announced, that at a certain station the parliamentary "shunts" to
  let the Express pass; or to hear the order&mdash;"shunt that truck," push
  it aside, off the main line. In the curious ballad put forth in 1550,
  called "John Nobody" (Strype's <i>Life of Cranmer</i>, App. p. 138.), in
  derision of the Reformed church, the writer describes how, hearing the
  sound of a "synagogue," namely, a congregation of the new faith, he hid
  himself in alarm:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The I drew me down into a dale, wheras the dumb deer</p>
      <p>Did shiver for a shower, but I shunted from a freyke,</p>
      <p>For I would no wight in this world wist who I were."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>{205}</span></p>

  <p>In the Townley Mysteries, <i>Ascensio Domini</i>, p. 303., the Virgin
  Mary calls upon St. John to protect her against the Jews,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Mi fleshe it qwakes, as lefe on lynde,</p>
      <p>To shontt the shrowres sharper than thorne,"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>explained in the Glossary, "sconce or ward off." Sewel, in his
  <i>English and Dutch Dictionary</i>, 1766, gives&mdash;"to shunt (a
  country word for to shove), <i>schuiven</i>." I do not find "shunt,"
  however, in the Provincial Glossaries: in some parts of the south, "to
  shun" is used in this sense. Thus, in an assault case at Reigate, I heard
  the complainant say of a man who had hustled him, "He kept shunning me
  along: sometimes he shunt me on the road," that is, pushed me off the
  footpath on to the highway.</p>

  <p>I hope that the Philological Society has not abandoned their project
  of compiling a complete Provincial Glossary: the difficulties of such an
  undertaking might be materially aided through the medium of "<span

<h3>THE CHAPEL OF LORETTO.</h3>

  <p>Among the aerial migrations of the chapel of Loretto, it is possible
  that our own country may hereafter be favoured by a visit of that
  celebrated structure. In the mean time, as I am not aware that the
  contributions of our countrymen to its history have been hitherto
  commemorated, the following extract from a note, made by me on the spot
  some years ago, may not be unsuitable for publication in "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>." As I had neither the time nor the
  patience which the pious, but rather prolix, Scotchman bestowed upon his
  composition, I found it necessary to content myself with a mere abstract
  of the larger portion.</p>

  <p>The story of the holy House of Loretto is engraved on brass in several
  languages upon the walls of the church at Loretto. Among others, there
  are two tablets with the story in English, headed "The wondrus flittinge
  of the kirk of our blest Lady of Laureto." It commences by stating that
  this kirk is the chamber of the house of the Blessed Virgin, in Nazareth,
  where our Saviour was born; that after the Ascension the Apostles
  hallowed and made it a kirk, and "S. Luke framed a pictur to har vary
  liknes thair zit to be seine;" that it was "haunted with muckle devotione
  by the folke of the land whar it stud, till the people went after the
  errour of Mahomet," when angels took it to Slavonia, near a place called
  Flumen: here it was not honoured as it ought to be, and they took it to a
  wood near Recanati, belonging to a lady named Laureto, whence it took its
  name. On account of the thieveries here committed, it was again taken up
  and placed near, on a spot belonging to two brothers, who quarrelled
  about the possession of the oblations offered there; and again it was
  removed to the roadside, near where it now stands. It is further stated
  that it stands without foundations, and that sixteen persons being sent
  from Recanati to measure the foundations still remaining at Nazareth,
  they were found exactly to agree:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And from that tim fourth it has beine surly ken'd that this kirk was
  the Cammber of the B.&nbsp;V. whereto Christian begun thare and has ever efter
  had muckle devotione, for that in it daily she hes dun and dus many and
  many mirakels. Ane Frier Paule, of Sylva, an eremit of muckle godliness
  who wond in a cell neir, by this kirk, whar daily he went to mattins,
  seid that for ten zeirs, one the eighth of September, tweye hours before
  day, he saw a light descende from heaven upon it, whelk he seyd was the
  B.&nbsp;V. wha their shawed harselfe one the feest of her birthe."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Then follows the evidence of Paule Renalduci, whose grandsire's
  grandsire saw the angels bring the house over the sea: also the evidence
  of Francis Prior, whose grandsire, a hunter, often saw it in the wood,
  and whose grandsire's grandsire had a house close by. The inscription
  thus terminates:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I, Robt. Corbington, priest of the Companie of Iesus in the zeir
  <span class="scac">MDCXXXV</span>., have treulie translated the premisses
  out of the Latin story hanged up in the seid kirk."</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p>"<i>Nettle in Dock out</i>" (Vol. iii., p. 133.).&mdash;If your
  correspondent will refer to <i>The Literary Gazette</i>, March 24, 1849,
  No. 1679., he will find that I gave precisely the same explanation of
  that obscure passage of Chaucer's <i>Troilus and Creseide</i>, lib. iv.,
  in a paper which I contributed to the British Archæological
  Association.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Fras. Crossley.</span>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We will add two further illustrations of this passage of Chaucer, and
  the popular rhyme on which it is founded. The first is from Mr. Akerman's
  <i>Glossary of Provincial Words and Phrases in Use in Wiltshire</i>,
  where we read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When a child is stung, he plucks a dock-leaf, and laying it on the
  part affected, sings&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2hg1">'Out 'ettle</p>
      <p class="i2">In dock</p>

      <p class="i2hg1">'Ettle zhant</p>
      <p class="i2">Ha' narrun.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</blockquote>

  <p>Then follows a reference by Mr. Akerman to the passage in <i>Troilus
  and Creseide</i>.&mdash;Our second illustration is from Chaucer himself,
  who, in his <i>Testament of Love</i> (p. 482 ed. Urry), has the following
  passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ye wete well Ladie eke (quoth I), that I have not plaid raket, Nettle
  in, Docke out, and with the weathercocke waved."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Akerman's work was, we believe, published in <!-- Page 206
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>{206}</span>1846; and, at
  all events, attention was called to these passages in the <i>Athenæum</i>
  of the l2th September in that year, No. 985.]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Soul separates from the Body.</i>&mdash;In Vol. ii., p. 506., is an
  allusion to an ancient superstition, that the human soul sometimes leaves
  the body of a sleeping person and takes another form; allow me to mention
  that I remember, some forty years ago, hearing a servant from
  Lincolnshire relate a story of two travellers who laid down by the
  road-side to rest, and one fell asleep. The other, seeing a bee settle on
  a neighbouring wall and go into a little hole, put the end of his staff
  in the hole, and so imprisoned the bee. Wishing to pursue his journey, he
  endeavoured to awaken his companion, but was unable to do so, till,
  resuming his stick, the bee flew to the sleeping man and went into his
  ear. His companion then awoke him, remarking how soundly he had been
  sleeping, and asked what had he been dreaming of? "Oh!" said he, "I
  dreamt that you shut me up in a dark cave and I could not awake till you
  let me out." The person who told me the story firmly believed that the
  man's soul was in the bee.</p>

  <p><i>Lady's Trees.</i>&mdash;In some parts of Cornwall, small branches
  of sea-weed, dried and fastened in turned wooden stands, are set up as
  ornaments on the chimney-piece, &amp;c. The poor people suppose that they
  preserve the house from fire, and they are known by the name of
  "<i>Lady's trees</i>," in honour, I presume, of the Virgin Mary.</p>

  <p>So thought Matthew Prior; and if that rule had been attended to,
  neither would Lord Byron have deemed it worth notice that "<i>the knell
  of parting day</i>," in Gray's Elegy, "was adopted from Dante;" nor would
  Mr. Cary have remarked upon "this plagiarism," if indeed <i>he</i> used
  the term. (I refer to "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," Vol.
  iii., p. 35.) The truth is, that in every good edition of Gray's
  <i>Works</i>, there is a note to the line in question, <i>by the poet
  himself</i>, expressly stating that the passage is "<i>an imitation of
  the quotation from Dante</i>" thus brought forward.</p>

  <p>I could furnish you with various <i>notes</i> on Gray, pointing out
  remarkable coincidences of sentiment and expression between himself and

  <p><i>Richard III., Traditional Notice of.</i>&mdash;I have an aunt, now
  eighty-nine years of age, who in early life knew one who was in the habit
  of saying:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I knew a man, who knew a man, who knew a man who danced at court in
  the days of Richard III."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus there have been but three links between one who knew Richard III.
  and one now alive.</p>

  <p>My aunt's acquaintance could name his three predecessors, who were
  members of his own family: <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>{207}</span>their names have been forgotten, but his
  name was Harrison, and he was a member of an old Yorkshire family, and
  late in life settled in Bedfordshire.</p>

  <p>Richard died in 1484, and thus five persons have sufficed to chronicle
  an incident which occurred nearly 370 years since.</p>

  <p>Mr. Harrison further stated that there was nothing remarkable about
  Richard, that he was not the hunchback "lump of foul deformity" so
  generally believed until of late years.</p>

  <p>The foregoing anecdote may be of interest as showing that traditions
  may come down from remote periods by few links, and thus be but little
  differing from the actual occurrences.</p>

  <p><i>Oliver Cromwell.</i>&mdash;Echard says that his highness sold
  himself to the devil, and <i>that he had seen the solemn compact</i>.
  Anthony à Wood, who doubtless credited this account of a furious brother
  loyalist, in his Journal says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Aug. 30, 1658. Monday, a terrible raging wind happened, which did
  much damage. Dennis Bond, a great Oliverian and anti-monarchist, died on
  that day, and then the devil took <i>bond</i> for Oliver's
  appearance."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Clarendon, assigning the Protector to eternal perdition, not liking to
  lose the portent, boldly says the remarkable hurricane occurred on
  September 3, the day of Oliver's death. Oliver's admirers, on the other
  hand, represent this wind as ushering him into the other world, but for a
  very different reason.</p>

  <p>Heath, in his <i>Flagellum</i> (I have the 4th edit.), says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It pleased God to usher in his end with a great whale <i>some three
  months before</i>, June 2, that came up as far as Greenwich, and there
  was killed; and more immediately by a terrible storm of wind: the
  prognosticks that the great Leviathan of men, that tempest and overthrow
  of government, was now going to his own place!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have several works concerning Cromwell, but in no other do I find
  this story very like a whale. Would some reader of better opportunities
  favour us with a record of these two matters of natural history, not as
  connected with the death of this remarkable man, but as mere events? Your
  well-read readers will remember some similar tales relative to the death
  of Cardinal Mazarine. These exuberances of vulgar minds may partly be
  attributed to the credulity of the age, but more probably to the same
  want of philosophy which caused the ancients to deal in exaggeration.</p>

  horrible <i>Limacotrophy</i>.</p>

  <p>"We hooks them out of the wall (she says) with a stick, in winter

  takes them out with a fork, and eats them. Sometimes we has a jug heaped

<h3>BIDDINGS IN WALES.</h3>

  <p>There is a nursery song beginning&mdash;</p>

      <p class="hg3">"Harry Parry, when will you marry?</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Does this mean that I will come without an invitation, or without a
  marriage-present? It will be observed that Parry is a Welsh name, and
  that bidding is a Welsh custom, as is shown by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Spurrell</span> (Vol. iii., p. 114.). He has anticipated my intention of
  sending you a bidding-form, which has been lying upon my table for some
  weeks, but which I have not had time to transcribe; I now send it you,
  because it somewhat varies from <span class="sc">Mr. Spurrell's</span>,
  and yet so much resembles it as to show that the same formula is
  preserved. Both show that the presents are considered as debts,
  transferable or assignable to other parties. Is this the case in all
  districts of Wales where the custom of bidding prevails? I think I have
  heard that in some places the gift is to be returned only when the actual
  donor "enters into the matrimonial state." It will be observed, too, in
  these forms, relations only transfer to relations. Is it considered that
  they may assign to persons not relations? Some of your Welsh
  correspondents may reply to these questions, which may elucidate all the
  varieties of practice in a custom which contributes much to the comfort
  of a young couple, and, in many instances, is an incentive to prudence,
  because they are aware that the debt is a debt of honour, not to be
  evaded without some loss of character.</p>

  <p><i>Ballad Editing.</i>&mdash;The "<i>Outlandish Knight</i>" (Vol.

  "valuable contribution to our stock of ballad literature" in the hands of
  Mr. Rimbault, and thought the treatment it received no better than it
  deserved. <i>Blackwood</i>, May, 1847, reviewed Mr. Sheldon's book, and
  pointed out several instances of his "godfathership;" among others, his
  ballad of the "Outlandish Knight," which he obtained from "a copy in the
  possession of a gentleman at Newcastle," was condemned by the reviewer as
  "a vamped version of the Scotch ballad of 'May Collean.'" It may be as
  the reviewer states, but the question I would wish answered is one
  affecting the reviewer himself; for, if I mistake not, the Southron
  "Outlandish Knight" is the original of "May Collean" itself. I have by me
  a copy, in black letter, of the "Outlandish Knight," English in every
  respect, and as such differing considerably from Mr. Sheldon's border
  edition, and from "May Collean;" and, with some slight alterations, the
  ballad I have is yet popularly known through the midland counties. If any
  of your correspondents can oblige me with a reference to the first
  appearance of "May Collean," sheet or book, I shall esteem it a

  after the Relief Bill passed. In 1824 a Bill was passed to enable him to
  exercise the office of Earl Marshal without taking certain oaths, but
  gave him no seat in the House. We may as well add, that Lord Eldon's joke

<h3>THE MEANING OF EISELL.</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p>[This controversy is becoming a little too warm for our pages. But
  <span class="sc">Mr. Causton</span> is entitled to have some portion of
  the letter he has sent to us inserted. He writes with reference to the
  communications from <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> and <span
  class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> in our 68th number, p. 119., in reply to
  <span class="sc">Mr. C.'s</span> Article, which, although it had been in
  our hands a considerable time, was not inserted until out 65th Number, p.
  66.; a delay which gave to that article the appearance of an attempt to
  revive a discussion, whereas it really was written only in continuance of
  one.]</p>

</div>

  <p>To <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> I suggest, that whether the
  notion of "drinking up a river," or "eating a crocodile," be the more
  "unmeaning" or "out of place," must after all be a mere matter of
  opinion, as the latter must remain a question of taste; since it seems to
  be his settled conviction that it is not "impossible," but only
  "extravagant." Archdeacon Nares thought it quite the reverse; and I beg
  to remind your readers that Shakspearian crocodiles are never served <i>à
  la Soyer</i>, but swallowed <i>au naturel</i> and entire.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> is dissatisfied with my terms
  "mere verbiage" and "extravagant rant." I recommend a careful
  consideration of the scene over the grave of Ophelia; and then let any
  one say whether or not the "wag" of tongue between Laertes and Hamlet be
  not fairly described by the expressions I have used,&mdash;a paraphrase
  indeed, of Hamlet's concluding lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"Nay, an thou'lt <i>mouth</i>,</p>
      <p>I'll <i>rant</i> as well as thou."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Doubtless Shakspeare had a purpose in everything he wrote, and his
  purpose at this time was to work up the scene to the most effective
  conclusion, and to display the excitement of Hamlet in a series of
  beautiful images, which, nevertheless, the queen his mother immediately
  pronounced to be "mere madness," and which one must be as mad as Hamlet
  himself to adopt as feats literally to be performed.</p>

  <p>The offence is rank in the eyes of <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>
  that I should have styled <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> his friend.
  The amenities of literature, I now perceive, do not extend to the case,
  and a new canon is required, to the effect that "when one gentleman is
  found bolstering up the argument of another, he is not, ever for the
  nonce, to be taken for his friend." I think the denial to be expressed in
  rather strong language; but I hasten to make the <i>amende</i> suitable
  to the occasion, by withdrawing the "falsehood and unfounded
  insinuation."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> has further charged me with "want
  of truth," in stating that the question remains "substantially where
  Steevens and Malone had left it." Wherein, I ask, substantially consists
  the difference?</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> has merely substituted his
  "wormwood wine" for Malone's vinegar; and before he can make it as
  palatable to common sense, and Shakspeare's "logical correctness and
  nicety of expression," as it was to Creed and Shepley, he must get over
  the "stalking-horse," the <i>drink</i> <span class="scac">UP</span>,
  which stands in his way precisely as it did in that of Malone's more
  legitimate proposition. <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> overleaps the
  difficulty by a bare assertion that "to <i>drink</i> <span
  class="scac">UP</span> was commonly used for simply to drink." He has not
  produced any parallel case of proof, with the exception of one from Mr.
  Halliwell's <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>. I adopt his citation, and shall employ
  it against him.</p>

  <p><i>Drink</i> <span class="scac">UP</span> can only be grammatically
  applied to a determinate total, whether it be the river Yssell or <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hickson's</span> dose of physic. Shakespeare seems to have
  been well acquainted with, and to have observed, the grammatical rule
  which <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> professes not to comprehend.
  Thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"I will drink,</p>
      <p><i>Potions of</i> eysell."</p>

  </div>
  <p>are parallel passages, and imply quantity indeterminate, inasmuch as
  they admit of more or less.</p>

  <p>Now <span class="sc">Mr. Singer's</span> obliging quotation from the

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2hg3">"Eat <span class="scac">UP</span> your cake, Jenny,</p>
      <p><i>Drink</i> <span class="scac">UP YOUR</span> wine"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>certainly implies quite the reverse; for it can be taken to mean
  neither more nor less than the identical glass of wine that Jenny had
  standing before her. A parallel passage will be found in Shakspeare's
  sonnet (<span class="scac">CXIV.</span>):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Drink up</i> the monarch's plague, <i>this</i> flattery:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>{211}</span></p>

  <p>and in this category, on the rule exponed, since it cannot positively
  appertain to the other, must, I think, be placed the line of
  Hamlet,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Woo't <i>drink up</i> eisell?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>as a noun implying absolute entirety; which might be a <i>river</i>,
  but could not be grammatically applied to any unexpressed quantity.</p>

  <p>Now what is the amount and value of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Singer's</span> proposition? He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Thomas's <i>Italian Dictionary</i>, 1562, we have '<span
  class="sc">Assenzio</span>, <i>Eysell</i>'<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>; and Florio renders that word [<span
  class="sc">Assenzio</span>, not <i>Eysell</i>?] by 'wormwood.' What is
  meant, however, is <i>wormwood wine</i>, a nauseously bitter medicament
  then much in use."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>When pressed by <span class="sc">Lord Braybrooke</span> ("<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," Vol. ii., p. 286.), who proved, by
  an extract from <i>Pepys's Diary</i>, that wormwood wine, so far from
  bearing out <span class="sc">Mr. Singer's</span> description, was, in
  fact, a fashionable luxury, probably not more nauseous than the <i>pale
  ale</i> so much in repute at the present day, <span class="sc">Mr.
  Singer</span> very adroitly produced a "corroborative note" from "old
  Langham" ("<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," Vol. ii., p.
  315.), which, curiously enough, is castrated of all that Langham wrote
  pertaining to the question in issue. Treating of the many virtues of the
  prevailing tonic as an appetiser, and restorer "of a good color" to them
  that be "leane and evil colored," Langham says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>["Make wormwood wine thus: take <i>aqua vitæ</i> and malmsey, of each
  like much, put it in a glasse or bottell with <i>a few leaves of dried
  wormwood</i>, and let it stand certain days,] and strein out a little
  spoonfull, and drink it with a draught of ale or wine: [it may be long
  preserved.]"<a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus it will be seen that the reason for "streining out a little
  spoonfull" as a restorative for a weak stomach was less on account of the
  infusion being so "atrociously unpalatable," than of the alcohol used in
  its preparation.</p>

  <p>Dr. Venner also recommends as an excellent stomachic,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To drink mornings fasting, and sometimes also before dinner, <i>a
  draught of wormwood-wine</i> or beer:"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>and we may gather the "atrocious bitterness" of the restorative, by
  the substitute he proposes: "or, for want of them," he continues:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"white wine or stale beer, wherein a few branches of wormwood have,
  for certain hours, been infused."<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Parr, quoting Bergius, describes <i>Absinthium</i> as "a grateful
  stomachic;" and <i>Absinthites</i> as "a pleasant form of the
  wormwood."<a name="footnotetag7" href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Is this therefore the article that Hamlet proposed to <i>drink</i>
  <span class="scac">UP</span> with his crocodile? So far from thinking so,
  I have ventured to coincide with Archdeacon Nares in favour of Steevens;
  for whether it be Malone's vinegar, or <span class="sc">Mr.
  Singer's</span> more comfortable stomachic, the challenge to drink either
  "<i>in such a rant</i>, is so inconsistent, and even ridiculous, that we
  must decide for the river, whether its name be exactly found or not."<a
  name="footnotetag8" href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I am quite unconscious of any purport in my remarks, other than they
  appear on paper; and I should be sorry indeed to accuse <span
  class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> of being "ignorant" of anything; but I
  venture to suggest that those young gentlemen of surpassing spirit, who
  ate crocodiles, <i>drank</i> <span class="scac">UP</span> eisell, and
  committed other anomalies against nature in honor of their mistresses,
  belonged decidedly to a period of time anterior to that of Shakspeare,
  and went quite out with the age of chivalry, of which Shakspeare saw
  scarcely even the fag end. Your lover of Shakspeare's time was quite
  another animal. He had begun to take beer. He had become much more subtle
  and self-satisfied. He did sometimes pen sonnets to his mistress's
  eye-brow, and sing soft nothings to the gentle sighing of his "Lewte." He
  sometimes indeed looked "pale and wan;" but, rather than for love, it was
  more than probably from his immoderate indulgence in the "newe weede,"
  which he <i>drank</i><a name="footnotetag9"
  href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, though I never discovered that it
  was <i>drank up</i> by him. He generally wore a doublet and breeches of
  satin, slashed and lined with coloured taffata; and walked about with a
  gilliflower in one hand, and his gloves in the other. His veritable
  portrait is extant, and is engraved in Mr. Knight's <i>Pictorial
  Shakspeare</i>.<a name="footnotetag10"
  href="#footnote10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It will be time enough to decide which of us has run his head against
  "a stumbling-block of his own making," when <span class="sc">Mr.
  Singer</span> shall have found a probable solution of his difficulty "by
  a parallelism in the poet's pages."</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>William Chilcott</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 38. 73.).&mdash;The few notes
  which follow are very much at the service of your correspondent. William
  Chilcott, M.A., was rector of St. George's, Exeter, where he died on May
  30, 1711, at the age of forty-eight. The coat of arms on the tablet to
  his memory indicates that he married a Coplestone. His daughter Catherine
  died in August, 1695. The first edition of the <i>Practical Treatise
  concerning Evil Thoughts</i> was printed at Exeter in 1690, and was
  dedicated to his parishioners. Robert Chilcott, whom I take to be the
  brother of William, was rector of St. Mary-Major in Exeter, and died Feb.
  7, 1689.</p>

  <p>There does not appear to be any evidence that the persons above
  mentioned, were descended from the Chilcotts of Tiverton, though the
  identity of the Christian names renders it probable. If the object were
  to trace their ancestors or their descendants, much might be added to the
  suggestions of E.A.D. by searching the registers at Tiverton, and by
  comparing Prince's <i>Worthies of Devon</i>, ed. 1810, p. 213., and
  Polwhele's <i>Devon</i>, vol. iii. p. 351., with Harding's
  <i>Tiverton</i>; in various parts of which eight or nine individuals of
  the name are mentioned; especially vol. i. book ii. p. 114.; vol. ii.
  book iii. pp. 101, 102. 167. 183., and book iv., p. 20., where the
  connexion of the Chilcotts with the families of Blundell, Hooper,
  Collamore, Crossing, Slee, and Hill, is set forth. Failing these, the
  object might be attained by reference to the registers at Stogumber, co.
  Somerset, and of Northam, near Bideford, with the inscribed floorstones
  in the church there. Something might perhaps be learned of their
  descendants by reference to the registers at Exeter, and those at
  Morchard-Bishop, where a John Chilcott resided in 1700; Nympton St.
  George, where a family of the same name lived about 1740; North Molton,
  where C. Chilcott was vicar in 1786; and Dean Prior, where Joseph
  Chilcott was vicar about 1830. A Mr. Thomas Chilcott, who was an organist
  at Bath, married Ann, daughter of the Rev. Chichester Wrey. This lady
  died in 1758, and was buried at Tavistock, near Barnstaple. The coat of
  arms on the tablet to her memory is almost identical with the coat of the
  Rev. William Chilcott of Exeter first above mentioned.</p>

  <p><i>Fossil Elk of Ireland</i> (Vol. iii., p. 121.).&mdash;In the
  <i>Edinburgh Journal of Science</i>, New Series, vol. ii., 1830, p. 301.,
  is a curious paper by the late Dr. Hibbert Ware, under the title of
  "Additional Contributions towards the History of the Cervus Euryceros, or
  Fossil Elk of Ireland." It is illustrated with a copy of an engraving of
  an animal which Dr. H.&nbsp;W. believes to have been the same as the Irish
  elk, and which was living in Prussia at the time of the publication of
  the book from which it is taken, viz. the <i>Cosmographia Universalis</i>
  of Sebastian Munster: Basiliæ, 1550.</p>

  <p>Dr. H. W. in this paper refers to a former one in the third volume of
  the first series of the same journal, in which he advanced proofs that
  the Cervus was a race which had but very recently become extinct.</p>

  <p>"<i>By Hook or by Crook</i>" (vol. iii. p. 116.).&mdash;However
  unimaginative the worthy Cit may be for whose explanation of this popular
  phrase J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;S. has made himself answerable, the solution sounds so
  pretty, that to save its obtaining further credence, more than your
  well-timed note is needed. I with safety can contradict it, for I find
  that "Tusser," a Norfolk man living in the reign of Henry VIII., in a
  poem which he wrote as a complete monthly guide and adviser for the
  farmer through the year, but which was not published till 1590, in the
  thirty-second year of Queen Elizabeth, has the following advice for March
  30:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Of mastiues and mongrels, that many we see</p>
      <p>A number of thousands, to many there be:</p>
      <p>Watch therefore in Lent, to thy sheepe go and looke,</p>
      <p>For dogs will have vittels, by hooke and by crooke."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This must be a Norfolk phrase; for in January he advises farmers
  possessing "Hollands," rich grass lands, to only keep ewes that bear
  twins, "twinlins."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Blowen.</span>

  <p>This appears as a well-known proverbial expression long before the
  time pointed out by J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;S. Thus, in <i>Devout Contemplations</i>, by
  Fr. Ch. de Fonseca, Englished by J.&nbsp;M., London, 1629, we read that the
  Devil</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Overthroweth monasteries; through sloth and idleness soliciting
  religious men to be negligent in coming to Church, careless in preaching,
  and loose in their lives. In the marriage bed he soweth tares,
  treacheries, and lightness. With worldly men he persuadeth that he is
  nobody that is not rich, and therefore, <i>bee it by hooke or by
  crooke</i>, by right or wrong, he would have them get to be wealthy."</p>

  <p><i>Suem.</i>&mdash;Allow me to suggest to your correspondents C.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;G.
  (Vol. iii., p. 7.) and <span class="grk">&Delta;</span>. (Vol. iii., p.

  a <i>horse-load</i>, and generally a <i>burden</i>. For cognates, see
  Bosworth's <i>A.-S. Dict.</i> <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page213"></a>{213}</span>I may add, that the word is written
  <i>swun</i> in a charter of Edward the Confessor, printed by Hickes in
  his <i>Thesaurus</i>, vol. i. p. 159., as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"&mdash;ic ann <a href="images/72_thaet.png"><img

  J.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;C. The letter is from T. Howard to Charles II., written April 5,

  <p><i>Miching malicho</i> (Vol. iii., p. 3.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> is probably not aware that his
  suggestion respecting the meaning of <i>Malicho</i> had been anticipated
  upwards of twenty years since. In the unpretending edition of Shakspeare
  by another of your correspondents, <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>,
  printed in 1825, I find the following note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Miching malicho</i> is lurking mischief, or evil doing. <i>To
  mich</i>, for to skulk, to lurk, was an old English verb in common use in
  Shakspeare's time; and <i>Malicho</i>, or <i>Malhecho</i>, misdeed, he
  has borrowed from the Spanish. Many stray words of Spanish and Italian
  were then affectedly used in common conversation, as we have seen French
  used in more recent times. The Quarto spell the word <i>Mallicho</i>. Our
  ancestors were not particular in orthography, and often spelt according
  to the ear."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have since looked at <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> note to
  which he refers, and find that he interprets <i>miching</i> by
  <i>stealing</i>, which will not suit the context; and abundant examples
  may be adduced that to <i>mich</i> was to <i>skulk</i>, to <i>lurk</i>,
  as <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> has very properly explained it.
  Thus Minsheu:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To <span class="sc">Miche</span>, or secretly hide himself out of the
  way, as <span class="scac">TRUANTS</span> doe from Schoole, vi. <i>to
  hide</i>, to cover."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>and again&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A <i>micher</i>, vi. <i>Truant</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> text, too, is not satisfactory,
  for he has abandoned the old word <i>Malicho</i>, and given
  <i>Mallecho</i>, which is as far from the true form of the Spanish word
  as the old reading, which he should either have preserved or printed
  <i>Malhecho</i>, as Minsheu gives it.</p>

  <p>I am glad to see from your pages that <span class="sc">Mr.
  Singer</span> has not entirely abandoned Shakspearian illustration, for
  in my difficulties I have rarely consulted his edition in vain; and, in
  my humble opinion, it is as yet the most practically useful and readable
  edition we have.</p>

  <p><i>Cor Linguæ, &amp;c.</i> (Vol. iii., p. 168.).&mdash;The lines
  quoted by J.&nbsp;Bs. occur in the poem "De Palpone et Assentatore," printed
  in the volume of <i>Latin Poems</i>, commonly attributed to Walter Mapes,
  edited by Mr. T. Wright for the Camden Society, 1841, at p. 112., with a
  slight variation in expression, as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Cor linguæ f&oelig;derat naturæ sanctio,</p>

      <p>Sermo concipitur ex adulterio."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Mr. Wright's only source quoted for the poem is MS. Cotton, Vespas, E.
  xii. Of its authority he remarks (Preface, p. xx.), that the writer's
  name was certainly Walter, but that he appears to have lived at Wimborne,
  with which place Walter Map is not traced to have had any connexion; and
  if Mr. Wright's conjecture be correct, that the young king alluded to in
  it is Henry III., it must of course have been written some years after
  Walter Map's death.</p>

  <p><i>Under the Rose</i> (Vol. i., pp. 214. 458.; Vol. ii., pp. 221.
  323.).&mdash;I am surprised that no one has noticed Sir T. Browne's
  elucidations of this phrase. (<i>Vulg. Err.</i> lib. v. cap. 21. § 7.)
  Besides the explanation referred to by <span class="sc">Archæus</span>
  (Vol. i., p. 214.), he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The expression is commendable, if the rose from any <i>naturall</i>
  propertie may be the symbole of silence, as Nazienzene seems to imply in
  these translated verses&mdash;</p>

      <p>Indicatque suis prolixa silentia labris.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</blockquote>

  <p>He explains "the Germane custome, which over the table describeth a
  rose in the seeling" (Vol. ii., pp. 221. 323.), by making the phrase to
  refer only to the secrecy to be observed "in society and compotation,
  from the ancient custome in Symposiacke meetings to wear chapletts of
  roses about their heads."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Ache.</span>

  <p>"<i>Impatient to speak and not see</i>" (Vol. ii., p.
  490.).&mdash;There is no doubt of the fine interpretation of your
  correspondent; but it is not illustrated by the Latin. Also, I apprehend,
  "indocilis pati" is not put for "indocilis patiendi." It is a common use
  of <i>to</i>&mdash;proud to be praised; angry to be so ill-treated.</p>

  <p>It illustrates a line in Hotspur, the construction of which Warburton
  would have altered:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I then, all smarting, and my wounds being cold,</p>
      <p><i>To be</i> so pestered," &amp;c., <i>i.e.</i> at being.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>May I mention a change in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> which I have
  long entertained, but with doubt:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And with an accent tun'd in self-same key,</p>

  against Popery</i>, London, 1738, fol. vol. ii. tit. vii. pp.
  176&mdash;252.; and in the table of contents says that it was written by
  "Mr. Patrick, late preacher of the Charter-house." Not Bishop Patrick
  therefore, but his brother, Dr. John Patrick, who died 1695, aged
  sixty-three, was the author of this tract.</p>

  <p>"A Dying Father's last Legacy to an Onely Child, or Hugh Peter's
  Advice to his Daughter. Written by his own Hand during his late
  Imprisonment in the Tower of London, and given her a little before his
  Death. London, 1660:"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>which advice he ends, p. 94., with&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve you to his Heavenly

  <p>And then, after a poem at p. 97., he commences a short sketch of his
  life with&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I shall give you an account of myself and dealings, that (if
  possible) you may wipe off some dirt, or be the more content to carry
  it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That part of his life which would bear upon this subject reads thus,
  p. 98.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When (at Cambridge) I spent some years vainly enough, being but
  fourteen years old when thither I came, my tutor died, and I was exposed
  to my shifts. Coming from thence, at London God struck me with the sense
  of my sinful estate by a sermon I heard under Paul's."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The wonderful success of his lecture at Sepulchre's caused it to be
  asserted by his enemies, that his enthusiastic style of preaching was but
  stage buffoonery. (See p. 100.)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At this lecture the resort grew so great, that it contracted envie
  and anger ... There were six or seven thousand hearers ... and I went to
  Holland:"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>thereby leaving his character to be maligned. I do not believe, from
  the tone of the condemned man's <i>Legacy</i>, that he would purposely
  avoid any mention of the stage, had he appeared on it, and "usually
  performed the part of a clown;" in fact it appears, that immediately on
  his coming into London he was awakened by the "sermon under Paul's, which
  stuck fast:" he almost directly left for Essex, and was converted by "the
  love and labours of Mr. Thomas Hooker. I there preacht;" so that he was
  mostly preaching itinerantly in Essex, when it is asserted that he was "a
  player in Shakespeare's company." That <i>Legacy</i> in question, and a
  book autograph of Hugh Peters, are at the service of <span class="sc">Dr.
  Rimbault</span>.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>All who take an interest in English philology will join in the wish
  expressed a few pages back by one of the highest authorities on the
  subject, Mr. Albert Way&mdash;namely, "that the Philological Society has
  not abandoned their project of compiling a complete Provincial Glossary;"
  and will greet as a valuable contribution towards that great desideratum,
  every skilful attempt to record a local dialect. As such, Mr. Sternberg's
  valuable little book, <i>The Dialect and Folk Lore of
  Northamptonshire</i>, will meet a hearty welcome from our philological
  friends; and no less hearty a welcome from those who find in "popular
  superstitions, fairy-lore, and other traces of Teutonic heathenism,"
  materials for profitable speculation on the ancient mythology of these
  islands. We are bound to speak thus favourably of Mr. Sternberg's
  researches in this department, since some portion of them were first
  communicated by him to our Folk-Lore columns.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Vestiges of the Gael
  in Gwynedd, by the Rev. William Basil Jones, M.A.</i> A learned essay on
  the subject of deep interest to the antiquaries <!-- Page 215 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>{215}</span>of the Principality,
  involving, as it does among other questions, that of the claim of the
  Gael, or the Cymry, to be the aborigines of the country.</p>

  <p><i>The Book of Family Crests, comprising nearly every Family Bearing,
  properly blazoned and explained, accompanied by upwards of Four Thousand
  Engravings, with the Surnames of the Bearers, Dictionary of Mottoes, and
  Glossary of Terms</i>, in 2 Vols., Sixth Edition. The best criticism on
  this popular work, with its <i>well blazoned</i> title-page bearing the
  words <span class="scac">SIXTH EDITION</span> on its <i>honour point</i>,
  is to state, as a proof of its completeness, that it records the Crests
  of upwards of ninety <i>Smiths</i>, and nearly fifty <i>Smyths</i> and
  <i>Smythes</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Illustrations of Medieval Costume in England, collected from MSS.
  in the British Museum</i>, by T.&nbsp;A. Day and J.&nbsp;B. Dines. When before did
  English antiquaries see four plates of costume, some of them coloured,
  sold for one shilling? As an attempt at cheapening and so popularising
  archæological literature, the work deserves encouragement.</p>

  <p>Perhaps no name of modern times is productive of so many pleasant
  associations as that of Horace Walpole, and certainly no name was ever
  more intimately connected with so many different subjects of importance
  in connection with literature, art, fashion, and politics. The position
  of various members of his family connecting Horace Walpole with the
  cabinet, the court, and the legislature, his own intercourse with those
  characters who became remarkable for brilliant social and intellectual
  qualities, and his reputation as a wit, a scholar, and a virtuoso, cannot
  fail, it is hoped, to render his memoirs equally amusing and
  instructive.</p>
